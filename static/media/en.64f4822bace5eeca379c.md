## Hexadecimal

A *hexadecimal* or *base-16* number consists of 16 different symbols: digits from **0** to **9** and letters from **A** (10) to **F** (15).

Hexadecimal numbers are widely used in computing and binary numbers are sometimes converted into hexadecimal to make them more readable.

In some programming languages, hexadecimal numbers can be distinguished with the prefix 0x.
