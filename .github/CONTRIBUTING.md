# Contributing to the project

Hello there and thank you for your interest! **0b.is** is an open source project and we welcome all contributions, big or small. Please read this document before opening a new issue or a pull request. The aim is to make contributing as easy and beginner friendly as possible.

If you have any questions, you may email the [maintainer](https://github.com/rikurauhala) directly.

## Reporting an issue

Bugs or other unexpected behaviour can be reported using the [Issues](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/issues) page. Try to describe the problem in detail to make it easier to fix.

Don't hesitate to report an issue you may have found with the application. Even minor typo corrections are appreciated.

## Suggesting improvements

New features can be suggested or requested by opening a new issue. If you wish to contribute to the source code, fork the repository and make a [pull request](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/pulls). Please explain what you did and how you think it would improve the application!

Make as many pull requests as you want. I would recommend keeping the requests small and not changing too many things at once. Don't make a pull request you wouldn't want to review yourself!

Refactoring and optimizing existing code is also highly encouraged.

## Translating

Starting with version 1.2, the application supports different languages! To contribute to the translation effort, follow these instructions. You may add missing translations, suggest an improvement to an existing translation or translate the whole application into a new language! See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) which language code you should use.

Currently supported languages:
- :us: `[en]` English
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® `[fi]` Finnish (suomi)
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ `[it]` Italian (italiano)
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· `[ko]` Korean (í•œêµ­ì–´)

### User interface

Most translations are stored in the [languages file](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/src/languages/index.ts). User interface strings are stored in the const `languages`. To add a new translation, append the dictionary by adding a new translation to each item. Please keep the list sorted alphabetically for consistency.

Here is an example when translating into say, Swedish.

```typescript
// Before

// ...
'Read more': {
  'en': 'Read more',
  'fi': 'Lue lisÃ¤Ã¤',
},
// ...

// After

// ...
'Read more': {
  'en': 'Read more',
  'fi': 'Lue lisÃ¤Ã¤',
  'sv': 'LÃ¤s mer', // newly added translation
},
// ...
```

### Wiki links

Another thing to update for translations is the list of Wikipedia links to provide more information about various numeral systems. The links are stored in the variable `wikiLink` in the same file. In this dictionary, the *key* is the base of the system and the link should point to a corresponding article on Wikipedia.

```typescript
// Before

// ...
'2': {
  'en': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number',
  'fi': 'https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/BinÃ¤Ã¤rijÃ¤rjestelmÃ¤',
},
// ...

// After

// ...
'2': {
  'en': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number',
  'fi': 'https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/BinÃ¤Ã¤rijÃ¤rjestelmÃ¤',
  'sv': 'https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/BinÃ¤ra_talsystemet', // Newly added link
},
// ...
```

### InfoBox content

One last thing to update when translating is the InfoBox [content files](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/tree/main/src/components/InfoBox/content). They are implemented bit differently so here you must create new files. For example, consider you want to translate the base-2 (binary) info box content into Swedish. You would create a new file in the [directory "2"](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/tree/main/src/components/InfoBox/content/2) and call it `sv.md`. The translation should match what is written in the original [English file](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/src/components/InfoBox/content/2/en.md).

In addition to writing the files, they must also be imported into use by updating [InfoBox.tsx](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/src/components/InfoBox/InfoBox.tsx).

### Types

The new language must also be added to the Language [type](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/src/types/index.ts).

### Language button

To test the new translation, it must be added to the [language button](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/src/components/MenuBar/LanguageButton/LanguageButton.tsx) menu as an option.

### Documentation

Documentation does not need to be translated as the development is done in English.

## Style

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is used to enforce a consistent code style. The file [.eslintrc](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/blob/main/.eslintrc) contains the specific rules the code should follow. Before making a pull request, check the code style with `npm run lint`.

### Commits

Keep the commits small so they are easy to handle. Don't change too many things per commit. Commit messages should be descriptive. Pay attention to good grammar and use the *imperative mood*.

```bash
# Yes
$ git commit -m "Create README.md"

# No
$ git commit -m "Changed something"
$ git commit -m "Created README.md"
$ git commit -m "README"
$ git commit -m "Some changes"
$ git commit -m "Removed some links"
```

## Set up the application locally

If you wish you contribute to the source code itself, here's how to install the application and start developing on your machine. You should be familiar with React, JavaScript/TypeScript and have Node.js installed. I would recommend using Visual Studio Code but any other editor will do just fine if Code is not your thing.

### How to install

```bash
# Get the source code
$ git clone git@github.com:rikurauhala/0b.is.git

# Change directory
$ cd 0b.is

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

### How to run

After running the application, your default browser should automatically open and the app should be running locally. If not, go to http://localhost:3000 manually.

```bash
# Run the application
$ npm start
```

### How to test

Please make sure to always run the unit tests and the linter before creating a pull request.

```bash
# Run the unit tests
$ CI=true npm test

# Check the code style quality
$ npm run lint
```

## Useful resources

Here are some useful resources to help you make your first contribution.

- [0b.is documentation](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/wiki)

This is the most important page for all contributors. All relevant documentation can be found here. Please refer to the [software requirements specification](https://github.com/rikurauhala/0b.is/wiki/Software-Requirements-Specification) document for the vision of the final application. Please note that it is rarely a good idea or even possible to design a completely final product beforehand. This means that the specification will live with the development cycle and is subject to change. Even the specification is open to suggestions!

- [Material UI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview)

The user interface is built using Material UI. Their documentation is excellent and contains everything you need to know about different components.

- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

As React is very much powering the application, referring to the React documentation would be a good idea.

- [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)

TypeScript documentation could be useful when encountering issues with types or interfaces.

- [GitHub Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Useful when updating documentation or info box contents that are written in Markdown.

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en)

I cannot recommend this course enough. It will teach you everything you need to know about modern web development. Taking the course is completely free for everyone!
